# ibines

# Author: Ibon Cano Sanz

# A NES emulator coded in Python. Just for fun.

# CPython virtual machine is just not powerful enough to run this kind of code at decent speeds,
# so I recommend to use Pypy inside a Virtualenv to be playable. 

# PySdl2 and Numpy packages are mandatory!


# Running instructions:

# cd ibines
# python NES.py
